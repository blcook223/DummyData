DummyData
=========

Thanks for installing DummyData, the Sublime Text plugin that lets you quickly and repeatedly generate JSON data files!


Getting Started
---------------

In Sublime Text, bring up the command prompt by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac). Then, search for "DD" and select "DummyData: New Model."

This will create a DummyData model file, which you can modify or save for use in your projects. The model file includes function tags enclosed within curly braces and percent signs (e.g., "{% repeat 10 %}", "{% url %}", "{% boolean %}"). DummyData supports many functions; see the documentation here:

https://github.com/blcook223/DummyData/blob/master/README.md

With the DummyData model open, bring up the command prompt again. This time, select "DummyData: Generate DummyData." This will create a new JSON file following the structure of the model file. The function tags have been replaced with randomly generated data.
